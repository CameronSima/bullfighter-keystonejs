		h1 The Bullfighter
		p At The Bullfighter we demonstrate that you need neither a huge bank account nor a deep understanding of security analysis to day or swing trade. Using simple technical analysis and screening tools, we find opportunities and explain our strategies. With the advent of no-fee brokers, we can take positions with high probability of profit, but also exit when they turn against us with minimal loss. Our trading philosophy is to trade small and trade often. You will find that we complete anywhere from 3-5 trades per week, holding generally high volitility equities or ETFs for no more than 24-48 hours. We will begin our journey with an account of $1000.
